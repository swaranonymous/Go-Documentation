## Introduction

Go, also known as Golang, is a programming language designed for simplicity, concurrency, and scalability. This repository serves as a resource to help developers build Go-based web servers, understand core concepts such as goroutines and channels, and set up projects that are production-ready.

The documentation in this repo covers:
- Setting up a basic HTTP server in Go
- Implementing concurrency with goroutines and channels
- Building APIs, static file servers, and more
- Best practices for deploying and managing Go servers
